## üöÄ Core Features

This project implements a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and role-based permission system.

* **Public Portal:** Guests can view a list of all teachers and browse students organized by their batch (e.g., "BSc 10th").
* **Role-Based Access Control:** The site has 5 distinct user roles:
    * **Admin:** Full control. Manages user creation, batches, and rooms via the Django Admin Panel.
    * **Teacher:** Can update their profile, book classrooms, and manage their own bookings (update/delete).
    * **Student:** Can update their profile and view classroom availability.
    * **CR (Class Representative):** A special student who can also edit the notice board for their specific batch.
    * **Guest:** Can only view public-facing pages.
* **Authentication System:** Secure login, logout, and password management.
* **Profile Management:** Logged-in users can edit their own profiles (name, email, bio, phone, and profile photo).
* **Classroom Booking System:**
    * Teachers can book available classrooms for specific time slots.
    * The system automatically prevents booking conflicts and bookings in the past.
    * A public page displays the *current* status ("Vacant" or "In Use") and a full schedule for all rooms.
* **Dynamic Notice Board:**
    * The dashboard notice board changes based on the logged-in user.
    * Teachers and Admins see (and can edit) the "Teacher Notice".
    * Students see the notice for their *specific batch*.
    * CRs can edit the notice for their batch.
